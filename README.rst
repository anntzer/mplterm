``mplterm`` supports outputting Matplotlib figures directly to some terminals.
Currently, ``mplterm`` supports (to various degrees) the iterm2_, kitty_, and
sixel_ protocols, but other protocols may be implemented in the future.

This package's implementation is heavily inspired by itermplot_ and other
terminal integrations for Matplotlib, as listed below.

Install with pip_ (``pip install git+https://github.com/anntzer/mplterm``).
Use by setting your Matplotlib backend to ``module://mplterm`` (e.g. by setting
the ``MPLBACKEND`` environment variable to ``module://mplterm``, or by calling
``matplotlib.use("module://mplterm")``).  The protocol to be used is normally
auto-detected, but can also be configured manually.

Protocols
---------

The following protocols are implemented; they are listed in the default order
in which ``mplterm`` searches a protocol supported by the underlying terminal.

- The ``kitty`` protocol is supported by the kitty and WezTerm_ terminals.
- The ``iterm2`` protocol is supported by the iterm2, WezTerm, and wsltty_
  terminals.  Note that plain mintty_ is not supported.
- The ``sixel`` protocol requires a `sixel-capable terminal`_ (xterm_ and
  mlterm_ are known to work) and ImageMagickâ‰¥7.0.1.  Note that ``mplterm`` will
  automatically and silently set (once) the ``numColorRegisters`` resource to
  its maximum allowed value.

Animations
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``kitty`` and ``iterm2`` protocols provide different types of support for
(standard, timed) animations.  The ``kitty`` protocol runs the actual animation
loop in real time and updates the displayed figure, as would be done in a GUI
window.  The ``iterm2`` protocol instead saves the animation to a GIF file
(``save_count`` may need to be set accordingly) and then displays that file.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is done via the ``MPLTERM`` environment variable, which should be
set to a semicolon-separate list of codes:

- ``backend=...``: Set the underlying rendering backend (by default, "agg").
- ``protocols=...``: Force the protocol to one of ``kitty``, ``iterm2``, or
  ``sixel``.  This parameter can also be set to a comma-separated list of
  protocols, in which case they will be tried in that order and the first
  protocol supported by the underlying terminal will be selected.
- ``transparency``: Make the figure and axes background transparent, if the
  protocol supports transparency (the sixel protocol, implemented via
  ImageMagick_, doesn't support it).
- ``revvideo``: Reverse-video the colors (similarly to ``itermplot``).

Other terminal backends for Matplotlib
--------------------------------------

- ``iterm2``:

  - itermplot_.

- ``kitty``:

  - matplotlib-backend-kitty_.
  - xontrib-kitty_.

- ``sixel``:

  - matplotlib-sixel_ (not on PyPI; uses ``ImageMagick``'s sixel support).
  - sixelplot_ (wraps PySixel_; not a Matplotlib backend but rather provides
    ``sixelplot.show()`` which displays the current figure).
